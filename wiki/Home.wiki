= Java, SQL, & Salesforce =

What are you interest in finding?
  * Java packages for working with Salesforce ([JavaHome]).
  * ANSI SELECT/DELETE/MODIFY/INSERT commands that work with Salesforce ([SQLForceHome]).
  * Jython module for working with Salesforce ([JythonHome]).
  * Tools to Copy any Salesforce instance to a local RDBMS ([CopyForceHome]).

All of these tools are part of the *SQLForce* project. 

= Origins of *SQLForce* =

SQLForce was initially created for two reasons:
  * We needed ANSI SELECT, SELECT DISTINCT, SELECT/UNION, DELETE, MODIFY, and INSERT commands that just worked.
  * SOQL and Salesforce's record limits made it just too hard to modify a lot of records.
  * We needed to change all occurences of "United States of America" to "USA" and wanted to use a SQL UPDATE statement.

Overtime, the base java libraries have been used to various other tools including a rich Jython module. We have used the tools, especially the Jython module, for production tasks since 2009. The first time you write a script like:
{{{
UPDATE Contact SET MailingCountry="USA" WHERE MailingCountry IN ("United States", "US")
}}}
you will be hooked. For any Salesforce administrator, SQLForce simply saves a lot of time.

The java libraries use the partner wsdl and are typically upgraded within a few weeks after Salesforce upgrades.
